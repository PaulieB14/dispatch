# dispatch-service

> **Community project — not affiliated with or endorsed by The Graph Foundation or Edge & Node.**
> This is an independent hobby implementation exploring what a JSON-RPC data service on Horizon might look like.

A decentralised JSON-RPC data service built on [The Graph Protocol's Horizon framework](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/horizon/). Indexers stake GRT, register to serve specific chains, and get paid per request via [GraphTally](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-improvement-proposals/blob/main/gips/0054-graphtally.md) (TAP v2) micropayments.

Inspired by the [Q3 2026 "Experimental JSON-RPC Data Service"](https://thegraph.com/blog/graph-protocol-2026-technical-roadmap/) direction in The Graph's 2026 Technical Roadmap — but this codebase is an independent community effort, not an official implementation.

**Implementation status:** the contract, subgraph, npm packages, and Rust binaries are all deployed. The first provider is live and serving traffic. The full payment loop — receipt signing → RAV aggregation → on-chain `collect()` — is working end-to-end on the live provider. GRT settles automatically every hour. See [Network status](#network-status) for the honest breakdown.

## Network status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `RPCDataService` contract | ✅ Live on Arbitrum One |
| Subgraph | ✅ Live on The Graph Studio |
| npm packages | ✅ Published (`@lodestar-dispatch/consumer-sdk`, `@lodestar-dispatch/indexer-agent`) |
| Active providers | ✅ **1** — `https://rpc.cargopete.com` (Arbitrum One, Standard + Archive) |
| Consumer-pays escrow | ✅ Enforced — `X-Consumer-Address` required; no free queries |
| Receipt signing & validation | ✅ Working — every request carries a signed EIP-712 TAP receipt |
| Receipt persistence | ✅ Working — stored in `tap_receipts` table in postgres |
| RAV aggregation (off-chain) | ✅ Working — gateway `/rav/aggregate` batches receipts into signed RAVs every 60s |
| On-chain `collect()` | ✅ Working — GRT settles on-chain automatically every hour |
| Provider on-chain registration | ✅ Confirmed — `registeredProviders[0xb43B...] = true` on Arbitrum One |
| Multi-provider discovery | ✅ Working — gateway polls subgraph every 60s, rebuilds registry dynamically |
| Local demo | ✅ Working — full payment loop on Anvil with mock contracts |

The full payment loop is working end-to-end on the live provider. Requests generate TAP receipts, the gateway aggregates them into RAVs every 60s, and the service calls `RPCDataService.collect()` every hour — pulling GRT from the consumer's escrow to the provider automatically.

To become a provider: stake ≥ 10,000 GRT on Arbitrum One, provision it to `RPCDataService`, run `dispatch-service` alongside your Ethereum node, and register via the indexer agent. Full guide: [Running a Provider](docs/src/providers.md).

## Architecture

```
Consumer (dApp)
   │
   ├── via consumer-sdk (trustless, direct)
   │     signs receipts locally, discovers providers via subgraph
   │
   └── via dispatch-gateway (managed, centralised)
         QoS-scored selection, TAP receipt signing
         Two ways to identify the consumer:
           · X-Consumer-Address header (standard)
           · /rpc/{chain_id}/{address} URL path (graph-node, header-less clients)
   │
   │  POST /rpc/{chain_id}               (X-Consumer-Address header)
   │  POST /rpc/{chain_id}/{consumer}    (address in URL — no header needed)
   │  TAP-Receipt: { signed EIP-712 receipt }
   ▼
dispatch-service          ← JSON-RPC proxy, TAP receipt validation,
   │                         receipt persistence (PostgreSQL → RAV aggregation → collect())
   ▼
Ethereum client       ← Geth / Erigon / Reth / Nethermind
(full or archive)
```

Payment flow (off-chain → on-chain):

```
receipts (per request) → dispatch-service aggregates (60s) → RAV → RPCDataService.collect() (hourly)
                                                         → GraphTallyCollector
                                                         → PaymentsEscrow
                                                         → GraphPayments
                                                         → GRT to indexer
```

## Crates

### `dispatch-tap`
Shared TAP v2 (GraphTally) primitives used by both service and gateway.
- `Receipt` / `SignedReceipt` types with serde
- EIP-712 domain separator and receipt hash computation
- `create_receipt()` — signs a receipt with a k256 ECDSA key

### `dispatch-service`
Runs on the indexer alongside an Ethereum full/archive node.

Key responsibilities:
- Validate incoming TAP receipts (EIP-712 signature recovery, sender authorisation, staleness check)
- Forward JSON-RPC requests to the backend Ethereum client
- Persist receipts to PostgreSQL; background task aggregates into RAVs every 60s and calls `collect()` hourly
- WebSocket proxy for `eth_subscribe` / `eth_unsubscribe`

Routes: `POST /rpc/{chain_id}` · `GET /ws/{chain_id}` · `GET /health` · `GET /version` · `GET /chains` · `GET /block/{chain_id}`

### `dispatch-gateway`
Sits between consumers and indexers. Manages provider discovery, quality scoring, and payment issuance.

Key responsibilities:
- Maintain a QoS score per provider (latency EMA, availability, block freshness)
- Probe all providers with synthetic `eth_blockNumber` every 10 seconds
- **Geographic routing** — region-aware score bonus, prefers nearby providers before latency data exists
- **Capability tier filtering** — Standard / Archive / Debug; `debug_*` / `trace_*` only routed to capable providers
- Select top-k providers via weighted random sampling, dispatch concurrently, return first valid response
- **JSON-RPC batch** — concurrent per-item dispatch, per-item error isolation
- **WebSocket proxy** — bidirectional forwarding for real-time subscriptions
- **Consumer address identification** — two methods supported:
  - `X-Consumer-Address` header (standard path); returns `402` if missing or invalid
  - URL path: `POST /rpc/{chain_id}/{consumer_address}` — for clients that cannot set custom headers (graph-node, Ethereum execution clients, curl without header flags). The address is validated and encoded into the TAP receipt metadata identically to the header path.
- Create and sign a fresh TAP receipt per request (EIP-712, random nonce, CU-weighted value, consumer address in metadata)
- **Dynamic discovery** — polls the RPC network subgraph; rebuilds registry on each poll
- **Per-IP rate limiting** — token-bucket via `governor` (configurable RPS + burst)
- **Prometheus metrics** — `dispatch_requests_total`, `dispatch_request_duration_seconds`

Routes: `POST /rpc/{chain_id}` · `POST /rpc/{chain_id}/{consumer_address}` · `GET /ws/{chain_id}` · `GET /health` · `GET /version` · `GET /providers/{chain_id}` · `GET /metrics`

### `consumer-sdk`
TypeScript package for dApp developers who want to send requests through the Dispatch network without running a gateway.

Key features:
- `DISPATCHClient` — discovers providers via subgraph, signs TAP receipts per request, updates QoS scores with EMA
- `signReceipt` / `buildReceipt` — EIP-712 TAP v2 receipt construction and signing
- `discoverProviders` — subgraph GraphQL query returning active providers for a given chain and tier
- `selectProvider` — weighted random selection proportional to QoS score

Install: `npm install /consumer-sdk`

### `indexer-agent`
TypeScript daemon automating the provider lifecycle on-chain.

- Polls on-chain registrations and reconciles against config every N seconds
- Calls `register`, `startService`, and `stopService` as needed
- Graceful shutdown: stops all active registrations before exiting on SIGTERM/SIGINT

Install: `npm install /indexer-agent`

### `contracts/RPCDataService.sol`
On-chain contract inheriting Horizon's `DataService` + `DataServiceFees` + `DataServicePausable`.

Key functions:
- `register` — validates provision (≥ 10,000 GRT, ≥ 14-day thawing), stores provider metadata and `paymentsDestination`
- `setPaymentsDestination` — decouple the GRT payment recipient from the operator signing key
- `startService` — activates provider for a `(chainId, capabilityTier)` pair
- `stopService` / `deregister` — lifecycle management
- `collect` — enforces `QueryFee` payment type; routes through `GraphTallyCollector`, locks `fees × 5` in stake claims
- `addChain` / `removeChain` — owner-only chain allowlist management
- `setMinThawingPeriod` — governance-adjustable thawing period (≥ 14 days)

## Getting started

### Smoke test a live provider

Fires real TAP-signed JSON-RPC requests directly at a provider and validates responses.

```bash
DISPATCH_ENDPOINT=https://rpc.cargopete.com \
DISPATCH_SIGNER_KEY=<authorized-signer-key> \
DISPATCH_PROVIDER_ADDRESS=0xb43B2CCCceadA5292732a8C58ae134AdEFcE09Bb \
cargo run --bin dispatch-smoke
```

`DISPATCH_SIGNER_KEY` must be the private key of an address in the provider's `authorized_senders` list. `DISPATCH_PROVIDER_ADDRESS` must match the provider's registered address — it's embedded in the TAP receipt and validated server-side.

### Run the demo (quickest path)

Runs a complete local stack — Anvil, Horizon mock contracts, dispatch-service, dispatch-gateway — makes 5 RPC requests, submits a RAV, and proves GRT lands in the payment wallet.

Requires: [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) and Rust stable.

```bash
cd demo
npm install
npm start
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
cp docker/config.example.toml  docker/config.toml
cp docker/gateway.example.toml docker/gateway.toml
# Fill in private keys, provider addresses, and backend URLs.
docker compose up
```

### Build from source

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Run the indexer service

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
# fill in: indexer address, operator private key, TAP config, backend node URLs
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin dispatch-service
```

### Run the gateway

```bash
cp docker/gateway.example.toml gateway.toml
# fill in: signer key, data_service_address, provider list
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin dispatch-gateway
```

### Deploy the contract

```bash
cd contracts
forge build
forge test -vvv

cp .env.example .env
# fill in PRIVATE_KEY, OWNER, PAUSE_GUARDIAN, GRAPH_CONTROLLER, GRAPH_TALLY_COLLECTOR
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url arbitrum_one --broadcast --verify -vvvv
```

### Use the drop-in proxy

The quickest way to point any existing app — MetaMask, Viem, Ethers.js, curl — at the Dispatch network without changing a line of application code.

```bash
cd proxy
npm install
npm start
```

On first run the proxy auto-generates a consumer keypair, saves it to `./consumer.key`, and prints your consumer address and a link to fund escrow. No private key needed upfront.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
dispatch-proxy v0.1.0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chain:     Ethereum Mainnet (1)
Listening: http://localhost:8545
Consumer:  0xABCD...1234
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠  New consumer key generated → ./consumer.key
Fund escrow at:  https://lodestar-dashboard.com/dispatch
Consumer address: 0xABCD...1234
Or use an existing funded key: DISPATCH_SIGNER_KEY=0x...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Add to MetaMask  →  Settings → Networks → Add a network
  RPC URL:  http://localhost:8545
  Chain ID: 1
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[12:34:56] ✓ eth_blockNumber      42ms  0.000004 GRT   total: 0.000004 GRT
[12:34:57] ✓ eth_getBalance       38ms  0.000008 GRT   total: 0.000012 GRT
```

Then go to [lodestar-dashboard.com/dispatch](https://lodestar-dashboard.com/dispatch), paste your consumer address, and deposit GRT. The dashboard calls `depositTo()` on the PaymentsEscrow contract so MetaMask can fund the proxy's escrow directly — the proxy itself needs no ETH or GRT in its own wallet.

Configuration via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DISPATCH_SIGNER_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | Consumer private key. If unset, loaded from `./consumer.key` or generated fresh |
| `DISPATCH_CHAIN_ID` | `1` | Chain to proxy (1 = Ethereum, 42161 = Arbitrum One, etc.) |
| `DISPATCH_PORT` | `8545` | Local port to listen on |
| `DISPATCH_BASE_PRICE_PER_CU` | `4000000000000` | GRT wei per compute unit |

### Use the Consumer SDK

```bash
npm install @lodestar-dispatch/consumer-sdk
```

The live gateway is `https://gateway.lodestar-dashboard.com`. All requests require an `X-Consumer-Address` header for billing and rate-limiting. The gateway manages its own on-chain GRT escrow — gateway users do not need to deposit GRT themselves. See [docs/consumers.md](docs/src/consumers.md).

```typescript
import { DISPATCHClient } from "@lodestar-dispatch/consumer-sdk";

const client = new DISPATCHClient({
  chainId: 42161,   // Arbitrum One — only live chain currently
  dataServiceAddress: "0x7101d5c1a5c89c3647f5118da118e56c023ba0b9",
  graphTallyCollector: "0x8f69F5C07477Ac46FBc491B1E6D91E2bb0111A9e",
  subgraphUrl: "https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/1747796/rpc-network/v0.3.0",
  signerPrivateKey: process.env.CONSUMER_KEY as `0x${string}`,
  basePricePerCU: 4_000_000_000_000n,
});

const block = await client.request("eth_blockNumber", []);
```

### Run the indexer agent

```bash
npm install @lodestar-dispatch/indexer-agent
```

```typescript
import { IndexerAgent } from "@lodestar-dispatch/indexer-agent";

const agent = new IndexerAgent({
  arbitrumRpcUrl: "https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc",
  rpcDataServiceAddress: "0x7101d5c1a5c89c3647f5118da118e56c023ba0b9",
  operatorPrivateKey: process.env.OPERATOR_KEY as `0x${string}`,
  providerAddress: "0x...",
  endpoint: "https://rpc.my-indexer.com",
  geoHash: "u1hx",
  paymentsDestination: "0x...",
  services: [
    { chainId: 1,     tier: 0 },
    { chainId: 42161, tier: 0 },
  ],
});

await agent.reconcile(); // call on a cron/interval
```

## Dogfooding: using Dispatch as graph-node's RPC source

Lodestar operates both sides of the network simultaneously: as a **provider** (Chainstack archive nodes serving Arbitrum One and Base) and as a **consumer** (graph-node uses the dispatch gateway as its primary RPC source for those chains).

This validates the full payment loop under real indexing load: graph-node fires thousands of `eth_getLogs`, `eth_call`, `trace_block` and archive calls daily — dispatch routes them to the Chainstack backends, receipts accumulate, RAVs aggregate every 60s, GRT settles hourly.

**How it works:**

graph-node cannot set custom HTTP headers, which is why the `POST /rpc/{chain_id}/{consumer_address}` route exists. The operator wallet address is embedded in the URL:

```
https://gateway.lodestar-dashboard.com/rpc/42161/0xB70781305939A39e74Aa918416Df1b893e1Bd904
https://gateway.lodestar-dashboard.com/rpc/8453/0xB70781305939A39e74Aa918416Df1b893e1Bd904
```

**graph-node `config.toml`:**

```toml
[chains.arbitrum-one]
shard = "primary"
provider = [
  { label = "dispatch-arb",
    url   = "https://gateway.lodestar-dashboard.com/rpc/42161/0xB70781305939A39e74Aa918416Df1b893e1Bd904",
    features = ["archive", "traces"] },
  { label = "chainstack-arb",
    url   = "https://arbitrum-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_KEY",
    features = ["archive", "traces"] }
]

[chains.base]
shard = "primary"
provider = [
  { label = "dispatch-base",
    url   = "https://gateway.lodestar-dashboard.com/rpc/8453/0xB70781305939A39e74Aa918416Df1b893e1Bd904",
    features = ["archive", "traces"] },
  { label = "chainstack-base",
    url   = "https://base-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_KEY",
    features = ["archive", "traces"] }
]
```

graph-node round-robins and retries automatically — dispatch goes first, Chainstack is the fallback. No proxy, no sidecar, no custom build.

**Economics:** The operator wallet funds `PaymentsEscrow` as consumer. GRT flows out per request and back in hourly via `collect()`, minus ~2% protocol fees. Net cost of self-consumption is negligible; the value is production validation and automatic Chainstack failover.

## Relation to existing Graph Protocol infrastructure

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| HorizonStaking / GraphPayments / PaymentsEscrow | ✅ Reused as-is |
| GraphTallyCollector (TAP v2) | ✅ Reused as-is |
| `indexer-tap-agent` | ❌ Not used — TAP aggregation and on-chain collection are built into `dispatch-service` |
| `indexer-service-rs` TAP middleware | ✅ Logic ported to `dispatch-service` |
| `indexer-agent` | ✅ `/indexer-agent` npm package handles register/startService/stopService lifecycle |
| `edgeandnode/gateway` | ✅ `dispatch-gateway` implements equivalent logic for RPC; `/consumer-sdk` provides trustless alternative |
| Graph Node | ❌ Not needed — standard Ethereum clients only |
| POI / SubgraphService dispute system | ❌ Not applicable |
